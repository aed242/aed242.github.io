                    <p>HelloðŸ‘‹! Thanks for checking out my page! I'm passionate about Full Stack Web Development, FinTech, Data Analytics, and am currently looking for Web/Software Development internships to utilize and strengthen my development and analytical skills.</p>

                <div class = "about-col-1">
                    <p>I've been fortunate to intern with large companies such as State Farm, Moss Adams, and the Department of Energy. I hold undergraduate degrees in both MIS and Accounting. My undergrad program gave me a solid base in programming, and I am currently in a Masters program for Software Development at Boston University<br><br>
                    I began to program in Java and VBA, and continue to develop my skills in JavaScript, web frameworks/processes/design, and Python. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this website. However, my skills and capabilites expand beyond front end development! <br><br>Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or email to discuss possible opportunities!</p>
